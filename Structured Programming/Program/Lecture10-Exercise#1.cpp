/*
每char str[10] = {'y', 'e', 's'};
  It is incorrect because there is lack of '\0' in {}.
  
每char str[10] = "Good Morning";
  It is incorrect because str[10] have not enough room to store the string "Good Morning"
  
每char str = "Hi";
  It is incorrect because there is lack of [] after the str, so it is not defined as a string.
  
每char str[] = 'Good';
  It is incorrect because it should use "" if it is a string.
  
- char str[] = "O";
  It is incorrect because there is only one character, so "O" is not a string.
